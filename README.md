To reproduce results be sure that you have proper libraries for work with vtk-format files, because the solutions of FEM stored in such files. To get the solutions you should install FEniCS from here: https://fenicsproject.org/download/, Linux version seems the easiest one to deal with. To reproduce animations you can use ParaView.
